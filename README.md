# Order Game
## Rules
 - Each of the 25 letter cards contain a unique hidden number from 1 to 25.
 - Drag 5 cards on to the empty slots next to the sort button and press it to sort the cards based on their hidden number, ascending from left to right.
 - The goal is to determine the cards containing 23, 24, and 25 in the fewest number of sorts. Drag 3 cards on to the empty slots next to the verify button and press it to reveal all hidden numbers. The cards containing 23, 24 and 25 can be in any order.
 - Without guessing, the fewest number of sorts that can guarantee a success is 7.
